Relative file path './preprocessed_vcfs/chr14.27572179.28322179.CHB_15.YRI_0.seed_12.no_multi_allelics.no_multiallelics.filtered.vcf' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
