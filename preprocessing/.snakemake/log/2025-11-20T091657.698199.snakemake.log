Relative file path './preprocessed_vcfs/HERC5_locus_YRI_100_CHB_250.OutOfAfrica_3G09.no_multiallelics.freq' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.

MissingOutputException in line 43 of /grid/siepel/home/khalid/argsortium-inference/preprocessing/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
./preprocessed_vcfs/HERC5_locus_YRI_100_CHB_250.OutOfAfrica_3G09.no_multiallelics.freq
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
