Relative file path './preprocessed_vcfs/HERC5_locus_YRI_100_CHB_250.OutOfAfrica_3G09.no_multiallelics.freq' starts with './'. This is redundant and strongly discouraged. It can also lead to inconsistent results of the file-matching approach used by Snakemake. You can simply omit the './' for relative file paths.
